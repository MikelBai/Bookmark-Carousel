This extension takes inspiration from the "Carousel" scene from mad men. It's a bit of a play on words (commands?) with Ctrl-Shift-L being the command to "hop on the carousel."

Since this isn't on the chrome web store, you can try it out by: 

1. Downloading the whole thing into a folder.

2. Going into chrome's extensions page.

3. Clicking "Load unpacked" on the top left of the screen, then selecting the folder you've downloaded this extension in.

4. Turning on developer mode and loading the extension.

Then, hop on that Ctrl-Shift-L.
