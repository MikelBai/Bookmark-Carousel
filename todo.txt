1. Basic functionality
    CHECK - random selection of a bookmark 
    CAN CUT- option/choice to override new tab page
2. Desired functionality
    CHECK - we're reworking the whole thing 'cause I don't want to read through the user's
    whole bookmark library just to detect if it's bookmarked or not (seems like I can't
    use declarativeContent's pageStateMatcher to set my popup page...)
    CHECK - we'll have a hotkey, or the user can let their new tab be the carousel.
    CHECK - since we're so limited... we can either have the icon show all the time or when
    it's bookmarked/not bookmarked.
    CHECK - Hey, we're geniuses. Ctrl-Shift-L. Ca-rou-sel.
    TODO - letting bookmarks off the carousel (step off?)
    - has a pretty logo and a pretty ui
    - has a pretty description
3. Extending/Preventing bad things functionality
    (note to self: "stepping off" means the bookmarks move to the specified carousel folder)
    - choosing which folders to run the carousel
    - choosing the name/destination for stepping off the carousel
    - looking into potential weird behaviour of stepping off into the same folder
    - but it might be ok if we specify that you can't step off into a carousel'd folder
    - checkbox selection of carousel'd folders
