1. Basic functionality
    - random selection of a bookmark
    - option/choice to override new tab page
2. Desired functionality
    - letting bookmarks off the carousel (step off?)
    - choosing which folders to run the carousel
    - has a pretty logo and a pretty ui
    - has a pretty description
3. Extending/Preventing bad things functionality
    - choosing the name/destination for stepping off the carousel
    - looking into potential weird behaviour of stepping off into the same folder
    - but it might be ok if we specify that you can't step off into a carousel'd folder
    - checkbox selection of carousel'd folders
